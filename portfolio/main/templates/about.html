    <h3>Python Developer</h3>
    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm <span>Sagar Thapa</span>, a passionate and highly motivated Python developer, with a focus on <strong>Django</strong> and an eye for creating visually stunning and user-friendly web experiences. I have a background in <span>Bachelor Of Computer Application</span>, which helps me combine technical skills and creativity in every project.</p>        
    <p>ðŸš€ Iâ€™m always looking to expand my knowledge and skills by building projects, learning along the way, and adapting to new challenges. My goal is to master <strong>Django</strong> and transition into a full-stack developer while also exploring the exciting field of <strong>Data Science</strong> to integrate it into my future projects.</p>
    <p>ðŸ”§ With a deep passion for technology, I bring a unique blend of enthusiasm and adaptability. I am quick to embrace new tools, thrive in dynamic environments, and eagerly seek opportunities to grow and solve complex problems.
